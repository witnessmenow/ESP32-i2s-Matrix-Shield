# Examples have moved!

I have moved all the examples from this repo to the [ESP32 Trinity repo examples section](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Trinity/tree/master/examples)

The I2S shield and Trinity have identical pin outs so examples for each are compatible with each other, so I didn't think it made much sense maintaining two.
